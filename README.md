# CS427 Algorithms

Final Project
Given a weighted undirected connected graph G with n vertices and m edges, find shortest paths
from source vertex s to each of the other vertices using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
Represent the graph both by an adjacency matrix and by adjacency lists. The adjacency matrix
version should use a simple linear search to find the minimum distance vertex. The adjacency list
implementation should use a min-heap for efficient extraction of the minimum distance vertex.
Submit a technical report and the Java code (for both implementations) as a zipped Final Project
folder to Canvas. Follow the guidelines from the How to Write the Technical Report document.
Specifically, the report should contain:
• A performance comparison report with theoretical asymptotic analysis (worst case only).
Analyze efficiency based on graph size (n and m) and density (sparse vs. dense graphs).
Provide insights on which representation is more suitable for different scenarios.
• Compare performance by running both implementations on various test cases and
measuring their execution times. Represent the results using execution time graphs.
• Sample test cases demonstrating correctness and efficiency.
Grading Criteria:
(40%) Correctness and code quality
(20%) Asymptotic time analysis with discussion
(20%) Real-time execution efficiency comparison
(20%) Clarity of the report, including explanations, results, and conclusions
